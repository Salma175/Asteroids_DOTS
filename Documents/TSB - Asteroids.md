Unity Developer Test

Exercise:

You will need to develop a simple game prototype inspired by the classic [Asteroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYSupJ5r2zo), but with some addons.

How it Works

For references on the gameplay you could look at some articles ([here](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/294648/Check_out_the_handwritten_game_design_doc_for_Asteroids.php)[ ](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/294648/Check_out_the_handwritten_game_design_doc_for_Asteroids.php)or [here](http://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com/2019/10/asteroids-by-numbers.html))

But in our version we want to add the follwing mechanics:

Pickable power-ups

At least one shot variation power-up

A temporary invulnerable shield

Remember not to forget about implementing the UFO's enemies and hyperspace travel.

Requirements

The only requirement is that you implement the game in a Data Oriented way using [Unity](https://unity.com/dots/packages)[ ](https://unity.com/dots/packages)[DOTS](https://unity.com/dots/packages)[ ](https://unity.com/dots/packages)packages, apart from that

you are totally free to take your own tech and implementation decisions (but note that we will evaluate those too).

The game should run on the Editor (not need for Mobile support or special input devices), with keyboard or mouse controls.

Of course we are not expecting a full and completely polished game, just a good enough protoype showing the main

components and features, our interest is on how you design and implement the different systems and data models.

Bonus Points (not required)

Implement a fancy vector line renderer following the spirit of the original game.

Add some juice (sfx, vfx, micro-interactions, whatever you want).

Add as many power-ups and new game mechanics as you want.

You could go crazy and implement a full 3D version if you want.

Tools/Tech to use

Use git for version control.

Unity 2020.2.x.

Unity DOTS packages (Specially Entities one).

You could use any Assets you want, we suggest the cool Kenney [Space](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux)[ ](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux)[Shooter](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux)[ ](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux)ones.
